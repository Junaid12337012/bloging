      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold font-serif my-6">1. The Path of the Gods (Sentiero degli Dei)</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">This legendary hiking trail offers unparalleled panoramic views of the coastline.

    content: `
      <p class="mb-4">From intelligent code completion to automated testing and personalized user experiences, AI is fundamentally changing the landscape of web development. Let's explore some of the key areas where AI is making a significant impact.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold font-serif my-6">1. AI-Powered Coding Assistants</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Tools like GitHub Copilot and Tabnine are transforming the developer workflow. By leveraging machine learning models trained on vast amounts of code, these assistants can suggest entire functions, boilerplate code, and even help debug complex problems, significantly boosting productivity.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold font-serif my-6">2. Automated Testing and QA</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">AI can automate the tedious process of quality assurance. Intelligent testing tools can automatically generate test cases, identify visual regressions, and even predict potential bugs before they make it to production. This leads to more robust and reliable applications.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold font-serif my-6">3. Personalized User Experiences</h2>
      <p>By analyzing user behavior, an AI algorithms can tailor content, recommendations, and UI elements in real-time. This level of personalization, seen on platforms like Netflix and Amazon, is now becoming accessible for all web applications, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.</p>

    content: `
      <p class="mb-4">Sourdough baking can seem intimidating, but at its core, it's a simple process that connects us to an ancient tradition. All you need is flour, water, salt, and a little bit of patience. Let's break it down.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold font-serif my-6">1. Creating Your Starter</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The heart of any sourdough bread is the starter - a living culture of wild yeast and bacteria. We'll show you how to create one from scratch using just flour and water. It takes about a week, but the tangy flavor it develops is worth the wait.</p>
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/id/30/800/400" alt="Sourdough Starter" class="rounded-lg my-6 shadow-lg">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold font-serif my-6">2. The Bulk Fermentation</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">This is where the magic happens. After mixing your dough, you'll let it ferment for several hours, performing a series of "stretch and folds" to build strength in the gluten. This step develops the flavor and structure of your loaf.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold font-serif my-6">3. Shaping and Baking</h2>
      <p>Finally, you'll shape your dough and let it have a final rest (proof) before baking it in a hot Dutch oven. The steam trapped inside the pot creates that beautiful, crispy crust and soft, airy interior that every baker dreams of.</p>

    excerpt: 'Discover a simple yet effective time management method that can help you power through distractions, hyper-focus, and get things done in short bursts.',
    content: `
      <p class="mb-4">The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold font-serif my-6">How it works:</h2>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>Choose a task to be accomplished.</li>
          <li>Set the Pomodoro timer to 25 minutes.</li>
          <li>Work on the task until the timer rings.</li>
          <li>Take a short break (5 minutes).</li>
          <li>After four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This technique is effective because it helps you resist all of those self-interruptions and re-train your brains to focus. Each pomodoro is an indivisible unit of work, and the short breaks help maintain focus and prevent burnout.</p>
